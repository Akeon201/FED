# File-Encrypter-Decrypter

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is an implementation of a simple file encryption and decryption tool using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of operation. The program starts by prompting the user to select whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a file by typing 1 or 2, respectively. The user is then prompted to enter the name of the file they want to encrypt or decrypt. Depending on the user's choice, the program will call the encrypt_file() or decrypt_file() function from the cryptoFunc module.
